		<p>my focus areas include value-based decision-making and cognitive maps. i use computational modeling, fMRI, and intracranial EEG.</p>
		<p>specifically, i'm interested in how people calculate subjective value and how those calculations drive behavior.</p>
		<p>i'm also interested in how people construct and use cognitive maps in decision-making.</p>
		<p>my current research focuses on how cognitive maps are used to encode subjective value and how the brain regions involved in cognitive maps and value-based decision-making interact.</p>
